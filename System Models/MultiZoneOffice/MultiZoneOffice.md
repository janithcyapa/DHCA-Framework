# OpenStudio MultiZone Office Model Documentation

## 1. Generation Overview
The base model was generated using the **Create DOE Prototype Building** measure with the building type **SmallOffice**. It utilizes a **5-Zone setup**.

* **Building Type:** Small Office (5 Zones)
* **Building Standard Template:** 90.1-2019
* **Climate Zone:** 169-2013-1A (Tropical; e.g., Singapore/Colombo)

## 2. Weather Data
The simulation uses EnergyPlus weather data for Colombo/Katunayake.

* **Weather File:** `LKA_Colombo-Katunayake.434500_SWERA`
* **Design Day Data:** Imported from `LKA_Colombo-Katunayake.434500_SWERA.ddy`
* **Daylight Savings Time:** Turned **Off** (Specific to Sri Lanka context).

> **TODO:** Add electricity and water utility bills for calibration.

## 3. Schedules

### A. The "Disturbances" (Heat Loads)
These schedules dictate when heat is added to the room. The controller must reject this heat to maintain the temperature setpoint.

**1. Occupancy (`OfficeSmall BLDG_OCC_SCH`)**
* **Definition:** A fraction (0.0 to 1.0) representing the number of people in the room.
* **Control Context:** People generate sensible heat (approx. 120W each) and latent heat (humidity). When this schedule ramps up at 8:00 AM, the controller experiences a sudden step load.

**2. Lighting (`OfficeSmall BLDG_LIGHT_SCH`)**
* **Definition:** Fraction of lights turned on.
* **Control Context:** Lights add pure sensible heat to the air.

**3. Equipment (`OfficeSmall BLDG_EQUIP_SCH`)**
* **Definition:** Fraction of computers, printers, and screens turned on.
* **Control Context:** Adds sensible heat. This usually tracks closely with occupancy (people turn on computers upon arrival).

**4. Infiltration (`OfficeSmall INFIL_Door_Opening`)**
* **Definition:** Represents air leakage when doors open/close.
* **Control Context:** Leaks hot, humid Colombo air into the conditioned space, adding both thermal and humidity loads.

### B. The "Reference Signals" (Setpoints)
These are the targets ($r(t)$) the controller attempts to maintain.

**1. Cooling Setpoint (`OfficeSmall CLGSETP_SCH`)**
* **Definition:** The target temperature for cooling (e.g., 24°C).
* **Control Context:** If the room temperature ($y(t)$) rises above this value, the VAV damper or cooling coil valve must open.
* *Note:* "NO_OPTIMUM" indicates a fixed schedule rather than an adaptive one.

**2. Heating Setpoint (`OfficeSmall HTGSETP_SCH`)**
* **Definition:** The target temperature for heating (e.g., 21°C).
* **Control Context:** If room temperature drops below this, the reheater coil activates.

### C. The "System Logic" (Enable/Disable)

**1. Always On**
* **Definition:** A schedule that is binary 1 (On) for 24 hours/day, 365 days/year.
* **Purpose:** Used for simulation loops or safety sensors that never power down.

**2. HVAC Operation (`OfficeSmall HVACOperationSchd`)**
* **Definition:** Defines operation hours for the main AHU fan (typically 7 AM - 6 PM).
* **Control Context:** Outside these hours, the fan shuts down to save energy, ignoring temperature deviations.

### D. The "Comfort Parameters" (Physics)
These parameters are used to calculate occupant comfort levels (PMV/PPD scores) rather than controlling the HVAC directly.

* **Activity Schedule (`ACTIVITY_SCH`):** Metabolic rate. Typing at a desk generates less heat than physical labor.
* **Clothing Schedule:** Insulation value (Clo). Higher in winter (sweaters), lower in summer (t-shirts).
* **Air Velocity Schedule:** Speed of air moving over skin (used for draft calculations).

### E. The "EMS" Schedules (Advanced)
* **Schedules:** `ems_Perimeter_ZN...` / `ems_Core_ZN...`
* **Definition:** Automatically generated by the "Prototype Building" script for internal Energy Management System logic.
* **Action:** These can generally be ignored as they pertain to the default HVAC logic (which will be replaced by the custom VAV system).

## 4. HVAC Modification

### Step 1: Remove Default Systems
Delete the following 5 Zone HVAC units (PSZ-AC) to prepare for the VAV system:
1.  `Core_ZN ZN PSZ-AC-1`
2.  `Perimeter_ZN_1 ZN PSZ-AC-2`
3.  `Perimeter_ZN_2 ZN PSZ-AC-3`
4.  `Perimeter_ZN_3 ZN PSZ-AC-4`
5.  `Perimeter_ZN_4 ZN PSZ-AC-5`

### Step 2: Add VAV System
1.  Locate the **Packaged Rooftop VAV with Reheat** loop in the library.
2.  Click **"Add to Model"**.
3.  Add Zones to the loop with **VAV with Electric Reheat** terminals.
